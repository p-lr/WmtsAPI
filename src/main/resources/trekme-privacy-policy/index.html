                    <p>Depending on the User's specific device, this Application may request certain permissions that
                        allow it to access the User's device Data as described below.</p>
                    <p>By default, these permissions must be granted by the User before the respective information can
                        be accessed. Once the permission has been given, it can be revoked by the User at any time. In
                        order to revoke these permissions, Users may refer to the device settings or contact the Owner
                        for support at the contact details provided in the present document.<br>The exact procedure for
                        controlling app permissions may be dependent on the User's device and software.</p>
                    <p>Please note that the revoking of such permissions might impact the proper functioning of this
                        Application.</p>
                    <p>If User grants any of the permissions listed below, the respective Personal Data may be processed
                        (i.e accessed to, modified or removed) by this Application.</p>

                    <h3>Precise location permission</h3>
                    <p>Used to show the position of the User on a map. The collected location data is used on the
                        User's device only and is never sent to any third parties through the network.</p>

                    <h3>Background location permission</h3>
                    <p>Used to record the location of the User even when the application is closed or in the background.
                        Such a recording is started by the User only, and a foreground service explicitly indicates that
                        a recording is running. The collected location data is used on the User's device only and is
                        never sent to any third parties through the network.</p>

                    <h3>Storage permission</h3>
                    <p>Used for accessing the file system and store Application Data. This permission is asked on
                        Android 9 and below. </p>

                    <h3>Methods of processing</h3>
                    <p>The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure,
                        modification, or unauthorized destruction of the Data.<br>The Data processing is carried out
                        using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly
                        related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some cases, the Data may be
                        accessible to certain types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of this
                        Application (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or external parties
                        (such as third-party technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT
                        companies, communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner.
                        The updated list of these parties may be requested from the Owner at any time.</p>
                    <h3>Legal basis of processing</h3>
                    <p>The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some
                            legislations the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to
                            such processing (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following
                            legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is
                            subject to European data protection law;
                        </li>
                        <li>provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for
                            any pre-contractual obligations thereof;
                        </li>
                        <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is
                            subject;
                        </li>
                        <li>processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the
                            exercise of official authority vested in the Owner;
                        </li>
                        <li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or
                            by a third party.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the
                        processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or
                        contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract. </p>
                    <h3>Retention time</h3>
                    <p>Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been
                        collected for.</p>
                    <p>Therefore:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between the
                            Owner and the User shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed.
                        </li>
                        <li>Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate interests shall be
                            retained as long as needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information
                            regarding the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner within the relevant sections of this
                            document or by contacting the Owner.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given
                        consent to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may
                        be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the
                        performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.<br><br>
                        Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to
                        access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability
                        cannot be enforced after expiration of the retention period.</p>
